# JSCourse
Entire code base of the JavaScript course that I teach in 2017. When refering to these examples please remember:

- these examples are intended for students with no prior coding experience
- examples were built progresively as new language elements were introduced 
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org) library is periodically used as a teaching tool
