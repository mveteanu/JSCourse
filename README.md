For a much smoother introduction to coding (without the hassle of setup and configuration), I recommend [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com). The site also contains many of the examples featured in this course.

# JSCourse

This repository contains the entire codebase of the JavaScript course I taught in 2017. When referring to these examples, please keep in mind:

- These examples are designed for students with no prior coding experience.
- The examples were built progressively as new language elements were introduced.
- The [p5.js](https://p5js.org) library is occasionally used as a teaching tool.
