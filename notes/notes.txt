Lesson 1
========

- what is a web page
- <script> tag to place JavaScript code inside a web page
- edit a web page with notepad
- load a web page in a browser from local file system
- alert(1);


Lesson 2
========

- introduce Visual Studio Code for easier .html editing
- numbers, strings and expressions with operators


Lesson 3
========

- defining and calling functions (without arguments or return values)
- introducing p5.js and setup() function
- introducing p5.js canvas and coordinate system
- introducing basic p5.js functions: createCanvas, background, ellipse, line
- assignment: draw a house or car


Lesson 4
========

- real example of encapsulating code in functions (e.g. drawHouse, drawCar)
- exapding drawing toolbox: point, rect, triangle, fill, noFill, stroke, noStroke
- functions with parameters
- code modularization using functions with parameters
- introducing variables: declaration and assignment with constants


Lesson 5
========

- more about variables: incrementing, decrementing, assigning complex expressions
- for loop
- return values from functions
- excercise: make calculateSum function using for loop and return value
- assignment: create a function that draws a grid, the cell size being provided as parameter


Lesson 6
========

- recap what has been presented until now
- exercise: make factorial function using for loop
- assignment: display in a single alert() dialog the factorials of numbers from 1 to 10: 1!=1 2!=2 3!=6 ...


Lesson 7
========

- recap for loop and do together the assignment from lesson 6 
- present the "\n" character in strings
- finding the length of a string using s.length
- accessing individual characters inside a string s[i]
- exercise to display all characters from within a string using a for loop
- assignment: create a function displayDots(rows, cols) which should display a net of small dots made out of ellipses 


Lesson 8
========

- exercise (not done): make a script to display the multiplication table - with 1 number then with all numbers from 1 - 10
- arrays
- adding, removing elements from arrays (push, splice)
- for on arrays
- homework: create a function to draw a bar chart


Lesson 9 - 14+
==============

- recap


Lesson(s)
=========

- draw a sprite from an array
- game: catch the dropping balls

Lesson(s)
=========
- game: invaders

Lesson
======
- inline objects

Lesson
======
- string manipulation
    - assignment: var s = "text";
    - length of a string: s.length
    - char at a position: s[i]
    - position of a substring: indexOf(str);
    - extract a substring: substring(i1, i2)
    - split a string: split("str")
    - toUpperCase() / toLowerCase()
    - startsWith() / endsWith()
    - remove whitespaces from beginning and end: trim()
    - replace(str1, str2)
    - Number(str) and .toString()

Lesson
======

- polar to cartesian coordinates
    - circle from points
    - analog clock
- cartesian to polar coordinates
    - line pointing to mouse cursor
    - magnetic field
    - eyes following mouse
- RGB color model


Lessons
=======

- ASCII code -> encrypt / decrypt text by shifting letters
    - str.charCodeAt(index)
    - String.fromCharCode(num1, num2, ...)
- prime numbers
- find number of words ocurances in a text (using associative arrays)
- plot the sine wave
- plot the graph of a function (e.g. polynomial)
- javascript osrt
- bubble sort
- recursion


Backlog
=======

- 2D matrixes

- google question: write a function to generate a random 4 digit unique even number, the four digits cannot be the same, 1234 is valid, but 1134 is not valid

- exercice with conversion from string to codes
    - programming an encoder: turn a message into a sequence of numbers (e.g. comma separated)
    - programming a decoder: turn the numbers back into a message

- write a program that calculates the average word length in a sequence entered by the user

- write a program that uses a while loop to determine how long it takes for an investment to double at a given interest rate.
  the input is: the annualized interest rate and the out put is the number of years it takes to double.
  the ammount of the initial investment does not matter
